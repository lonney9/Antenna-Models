The Coax trap program computes design parameters for the construction of coaxial traps for HF usage. Typically these are constructed from PVC tube and RG58/59 coax.

Only 4 parameters need to be known: the design operating frequency, the coil form diameter, the coax diameter and the coax capacitance per foot. Coax characteristics are provided for various Belden cables.

Do not use foam dielectric coax, with the tight turns needed to form the coil the center conductor will migrate through the foam and may eventually cause a voltage break down or short damaging the trap.
