# Drive2EL

Excel workbook that will calculate drive impedances of two element phased arrays from the self and coupled impedance readings plus desired phase shift. The drive impedances can then be used to calculate phasing systems using coax delay lines or current forcing using [Feed2EL](https://ac6la.com/feed2el.html) or [Arrayfeed](https://eznec.com/misc/Arrayfeed/) ([PDF Manual](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lonney9/Antenna-Models/main/software/Arrayfeed/Arrayfeed1.pdf))

Formulas in this sheet are borrowed from ON4UN's Low Band DXing 5th Ed Excel sheet "w1mk-on4un-oh1tv-arrays.xls", this is a simplified version for two element arrays.

Some examples of how to do these calculations can be found at
