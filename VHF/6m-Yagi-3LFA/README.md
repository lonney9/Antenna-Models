# 6m 3 Element LFA Yagi

LFA (Loop Fed Array) Yagis were developed by [G0KSC](https://www.g0ksc.co.uk/).


These are computer optimized, have direct 50 ohm feed and very clean patterns which help further improve the signal to noise ratio.

My 3 element LFA installed at 10 mH / 30 ft, from my Seattle location the 60 degree beam-width covers most of the US and South America when aimed South East. Rotation is manual and the wider beam-width makes aiming less critical.

With this antenna and 100W during [2022 E-season](https://lonneys-notebook.blogspot.com/2022/09/first-year-on-6-meters.html) (my first year on 6m) I worked most US states, and several countries using FT8 weak signal mode.

## 3 Element LFA Stack

Stacking increases gain by surpressing the higher angle lobes and "pushing" that energy into the lower main lobe, maintaines the same beam-width of 60 degrees.

Model uses minimum 1/2 wave stacking distance, peak gain is at 1.25 wavelength stacking distance.

Model inclues a phasing line using two sections of 75 ohm coax, these must be odd multiples of 1/4 wave, in this example each is 3/4 wave long (4.5 m with VF of 1), meeting at virtual connection V1 where the source is connected.
