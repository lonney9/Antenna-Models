6m Moxon with 2m Sleeve Coupled Yagi - Design by KV5W.

Designed to be compact for portable use with a single feed.

2m Yagi elements are interlaced with a 6m Moxon.

Two reflectors are used on 2m to counter the interaction with the 6m Moxon and get the F/B and F/R 20 dB or better.

NEC5 Note: With the NEC2 engine this antenna appears to work nicely. The NEC5 engine, it has a poor F/B and match on 2m
which is the sleeve coupled band. Mostly unchanged on 6m.
