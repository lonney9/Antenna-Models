From https://egpreston.com/40mbeam.txt
Modeled for 7.15 MHz at 45ft height.
Tweaked element lengths for equal current magnitudes.
What the text describes is each element has 1/2 wave electrical line connected.
Where the two lines meet a 1/4 wave electrical line is inserted in series with one side or the other.
This sets the direction, with a switching network the direction can be made reversible.
I’ve never seen this design anywhere else before, and a model confirms it should work properly.
EZNEC doesnt agree with the SWR, a matching network might be required where the main feed-line connects.

 1) space each 40 meter dipole 34 ft apart
 2) heighth of dipoles is the same and 10 to 30 ft high; 15 ft is good
 3) make the dipoles as flat as possible, i.e., not inverted Vees
 3) cut each dipole to 67 ft and feed each in center with 50 ft RG8X
 4) connect each 50 ft run of RG8x to each antenna and leave them
    disconnected so each dipole can be tuned to 7075 kHz separately
 5) trim each dipole separately so that the lowest swr is at 7075 kHz
 6) use a 25 ft RG8X phasing line on the dipole in the beam direction
 7) connect the two coaxes in parallel at the rig using a coax Tee
 8) if 50 ft of coax is not enough, use 100 ft RG8X on each dipole

Note: The dipole not being tuned is not resonant when disconnected
Note: The velocity factor of RG8X is assumed to be 80%.
Note: Use the same feedline lengths, either 50 ft or 100 ft of RG8X.
Note: Coax feeds are 1/2 or full wavelength; 1/4 wave phasing section.
Note: In 40m CW band, f/b ~20 dB and in 40 m SSB band, f/b ~10 dB
Note: SWR < 2:1 across the entire 40 meter band.
