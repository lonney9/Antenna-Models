Opposite Voltage Fed (OVF) arrays were developed by Pekka Ketonen OH1TV. His site contains several examples in different configurations.

Elements connected via electrical 1/2 wave line.
Two lines can be used to meet at alternate common point, polatiry of one must be reversed, SWR and F/B bandwidth may narrow slightly.
Adequate current chokes needed at each feed-point.


First L network is a series loading inductor which resonantes the element it's in series with as a reflector.
The shunt is not needed and is open circuit represented by a 1M ohm resistor.

Second L network matches to 50 ohms, its output can be changed between V1 and V2 which reverses the direction of the array as it
simply changes which half wave line the loading inductor is inserted into.
