## Basic Antenna Models

Segemented for NEC-5 (even segments) at 75 MHz

- Dipole 40m at 10 m height
- Delta Loop Inverted Vertical at 20 m height 
- Vertical 43 ft Ground Mounted

## Delta Loop Plots

Inverted, fed for vertical polarization, low angle radiation for long distance communication
