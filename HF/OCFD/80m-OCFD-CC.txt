Optimized for 40m 7.175MHz.
Cap in middle corrects resonance on 80m with out affecting any other bands. 300pF = 3.8MHz.
Compensation coil in end of long leg pulls resonance down into band on 20m and 10m SSB phone segments. Compensation coil idea from WA7ARK's EFHW design.

Wire insulation based on Wireman 531 material #13 AWG PE jacket. Site says 0.5mm thickness which may be correct but in EZNEC 0.25mm is closer to actual. Diel C maybe off?
