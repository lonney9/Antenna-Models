EZNEC notes file.

Feed Point Loaded Off Center Fed Dipole (FPL-OCFD)

33% offset., 175 pF cap at the balun (in series with the long leg).
13 AWG, 0.5mm PE insulated wire (The Wireman 531 material). 0.25mm used in EZNEC matches reality, maybe the Diel C value is off?

In a conventional OCF 80 and 40m resonance is low, 20 and 10m ends up high.
One solution is the make the antenna longer to bring 10 and 20m into range, then use a cap to electrically shorten the antenna on the lower bands where it's become too long. Cap has diminished effect on higher bands.

Because the antenna is longer the impedance is higher, and suits a 4:1 balun at 55ft/16m height for example.
