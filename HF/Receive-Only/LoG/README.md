# Loop on Ground

My attempt to model this doesn't match KK5JY's plots.

This is likely because I'm using the NEC2 engine with EZNEC, modeling horizontal wires above high accuracy ground is accurate down to about 3" or 75 mm according to [this post](https://groups.io/g/eznec/message/247) on the EZNEC group by AC6LA. To properly model these may need the NEC4 or NEC5 engine.
