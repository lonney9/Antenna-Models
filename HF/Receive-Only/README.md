# Receive Only

Dedicated receive only antennas are used to obtain better SNR on the low HF bands (80m and below), and MF bands where local noise sources become a problem.

Attention to detail in regard to the matching transformers and rejecting common mode currents (noise) traveling on coax and control cables if used. Some designs require low noise pre-amps at the antenna.

Some are links to searches or the creators website, models created for LoG and K6STI loops, plan to add more time permitting.
